#APIs and Monte Carlo 
This project demonstrates how to use APIs, both open and keyed.  For the APIs needing a key, Alpaca is used along with an 
Alpaca key and seceret key.  Keys are held in a .env file and accessed using the dotenv package.  Data is accessed 
through the use of pandas df's.

This project also employs MOnte Carlo as a forecastng tool.  The MC package is held in a .py file instead of an external source.  
Many portfolio sims are run to forecast the distributions after a certain period of time.
